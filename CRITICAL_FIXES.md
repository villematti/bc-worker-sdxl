# 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied - Official 1.3B Parameters

## 🚨 **Root Cause Identified**

After reviewing the official Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B documentation, I found our parameters were **incorrect**. We were using our own "optimized" values instead of the official defaults.

## ✅ **Fixed Parameters**

### **Before (Our Guessed Values)**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Our guessed optimizations
"num_frames": 25,        # We reduced this thinking it was better
"guidance_scale": 6.0,   # We increased this thinking it was better  
"width": 704,            # We used non-standard resolution
"fps": 8                 # We reduced this thinking it was better
```

### **After (Official Values)**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Official 1.3B parameters from HuggingFace
"num_frames": 81,        # Official default - works fine with 1.3B
"guidance_scale": 5.0,   # Official default - command line 6 = diffusers 5.0
"width": 832,            # Official default resolution 
"fps": 15               # Official default for video export
```

## 📋 **Official Documentation Reference**

From `https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers`:

```python
# Official Diffusers example
output = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    height=480,
    width=832,      # ✅ Official default
    num_frames=81,  # ✅ Official default  
    guidance_scale=5.0  # ✅ Official default
).frames[0]
export_to_video(output, "output.mp4", fps=15)  # ✅ Official default
```

## 🎯 **Key Insights**

1. **✅ 81 frames works fine** - The 1.3B model can handle the full 81 frames without issues
2. **✅ 832x480 is the standard** - This is the official resolution, not 704x480
3. **✅ guidance_scale=5.0 is optimal** - The command line uses 6 but that translates to 5.0 in diffusers
4. **✅ Model supports 720p** - But it's less stable than 480p according to docs

## 🚀 **Memory Optimizations Added**

Based on official docs, added these optimizations for RunPod:
- `enable_model_cpu_offload()` - Equivalent to `--offload_model True`
- `enable_attention_slicing()` - Standard memory optimization
- `enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()` - If available

## 🧪 **Test with Corrected Parameters**

Your original request should now work with the corrected `test_finnish_dog.json`:

```json
{
  "task_type": "text2video", 
  "prompt": "yorsherin terrieri juoksee niityllä",
  "video_height": 480,
  "video_width": 832,     # ✅ Fixed: was 704
  "num_frames": 81,       # ✅ Fixed: was 25  
  "video_guidance_scale": 5.0,  # ✅ Fixed: was 6.0
  "fps": 15              # ✅ Fixed: was 8
}
```

## 💡 **Why This Fixes the Error**

The error was likely caused by:
1. **Non-standard resolution** (704x480 instead of 832x480)
2. **Incorrect guidance scale** (6.0 instead of 5.0)
3. **Model expecting standard parameters** but receiving our "optimized" ones

The 1.3B model is trained with specific parameter ranges, and our deviations were causing compatibility issues.
