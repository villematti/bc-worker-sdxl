# FIXED: RunPod Build Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ The Real Problem
The issue was that we added a **23GB Wan2.1 model download** to an already working build process. This caused the upload to fail due to size/timeout issues.

## âœ… Solution: Optional Wan2.1 Download

I've modified the integration to make Wan2.1 **optional**:

### Phase 1: Deploy SDXL-Only (Reliable)
Build with existing Dockerfile - **no environment variables set**
- Downloads only SDXL models (~3GB)
- Should upload successfully to RunPod
- All SDXL functionality works (text2img, img2img, inpaint)

### Phase 2: Add Video Generation (Once Stable)
Rebuild with environment variable:
```dockerfile
ENV DOWNLOAD_WAN2_MODEL=true
```
- Downloads both SDXL + Wan2.1 models
- Enables video generation functionality

## ðŸš€ Immediate Action

**Deploy your current setup NOW:**
1. Use your existing Dockerfile (no changes needed)
2. Don't set `DOWNLOAD_WAN2_MODEL=true`
3. Build should complete and upload successfully
4. You get a working SDXL endpoint

**Later, when you want video:**
1. Add `ENV DOWNLOAD_WAN2_MODEL=true` to Dockerfile
2. Rebuild to get video functionality

## ðŸ“Š What Changed

- `download_weights.py`: Wan2.1 download now optional based on env var
- `handler.py`: Gracefully handles missing Wan2.1 models
- Build size: 3GB (SDXL only) vs 26GB (with Wan2.1)

## âš¡ Quick Test

Deploy with current files - should work immediately since we're back to SDXL-only by default!
